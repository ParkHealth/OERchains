# OERchains

## 🚀 Vision
OERchains aims to create a decentralized, federated ecosystem for Open Educational Resources (OERs) using blockchain technology. We're not just building a platform; we're igniting a revolution in accessible, equitable education and knowledge sharing for all.

## 🌟 Our Mission
To establish cutting-edge infrastructure and standards that democratize knowledge creation, empower educators and learners, and open up a world of learning opportunities through blockchain technology.

## 💡 Key Project Aims

### 1. Federated Blockchain Protocol
- Develop a protocol similar to Mastodon, encouraging forking of the original chain
- Enable federation between forked chains, creating a diverse yet interconnected ecosystem

### 2. Cross-Chain OER Standards
- Establish blockchain metadata and file type standards for OERs across all major blockchains
- Create a universal framework for OER files and projects, ensuring interoperability and wide adoption

### 3. Expansive Definition of OERs
- Embrace a broad view of educational content, including:
  - Traditional formats (documents, books, papers)
  - Interactive media (games, virtual reality environments)
  - Augmented reality experiences
  - Multi-dimensional data visualizations
  - Wall art and other unconventional educational mediums

### 4. Citation and Attribution System
- Develop a standard for automatic citation trails
- Create plugins for major word processors (Word, Google Docs) to:
  - Publish work-in-progress to the blockchain
  - Establish authorship for original ideas
  - Evaluate and grade the originality of ideas based on existing OER inventory

## 🛠 What We're Building
- A decentralized, federated blockchain ecosystem for OERs
- Cross-chain standards for OER metadata and file types
- Smart contracts for fair attribution and incentivization
- User-friendly tools for creating, accessing, and publishing OERs
- Advanced citation and originality evaluation systems
