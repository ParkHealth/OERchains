# OERchains

## üöÄ Vision
[OERchains](/docs/OERCHAINS.md) aims to create a decentralized, federated ecosystem for [Open Educational Resources (OERs)](/docs/OERs.md) using blockchain technology. We're not just building a platform; we're igniting a revolution in accessible, equitable education and knowledge sharing for all.

## üåü Our Mission
To establish cutting-edge infrastructure and standards that democratize knowledge creation, empower educators and learners, and open up a world of learning opportunities through blockchain technology.

## Why OERs?

[OERchains](/docs/OERCHAINS.md) focuses specifically on [Open Educational Resources (OERs)](/docs/OERs.md) due to their established heritage in open knowledge sharing and their alignment with our core values of [open source principles](/docs/OPEN_SOURCE.md), [regenerative economics](/docs/REGENERATIVE_ECONOMICS.md), and [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development). 

[Learn more about why we chose to focus on OERs](./docs/WHY_OERS.md).

## üí° Key Project Aims

### 1. Federated Blockchain Protocol
- Develop a protocol similar to [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), encouraging forking of the original chain.
- Enable federation between forked chains, creating a diverse yet interconnected ecosystem.

### 2. Cross-Chain OER Standards
- Establish blockchain metadata and file type standards for [OERs](/docs/OERs.md) across all major blockchains.
- Create a universal framework for OER files and projects, ensuring interoperability and wide adoption.

### 3. Expansive Definition of OERs
- Embrace a broad view of educational content, including:
  - Traditional formats ([documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document), [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book), [papers](/docs/RESEARCH_PAPERS.md))
  - Interactive media ([games](/docs/EDUCATIONAL_GAMES.md), [virtual reality environments](/docs/VR_EDUCATION.md))
  - Augmented reality experiences
  - Multi-dimensional data visualizations
  - [Wall art](/docs/EDUCATIONAL_ART.md) and other unconventional educational mediums

### 4. Citation and Attribution System
- Develop a standard for automatic [citation trails](/docs/CITATION_SYSTEM.md).
- Create plugins for major word processors ([Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com)) to:
  - Publish work-in-progress to the blockchain.
  - Establish authorship for original ideas.
  - Evaluate and grade the originality of ideas based on existing [OER](/docs/OERs.md) inventory.

## üõ† What We're Building
- Advanced [citation](/docs/CITATION_SYSTEM.md) and originality evaluation systems.
- **Integration with Hugging Face Dataset**  
  [OERchains](/docs/OERCHAINS.md) is actively working on integrating the **[OER Foundation Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rolodexter/OER-Foundation)**, hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). This dataset enables users to query [OERs](/docs/OERs.md) through [large language models (LLMs)](/docs/LLM.md) to facilitate better access to high-quality educational content.
