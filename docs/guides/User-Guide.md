- **Metadata & Licensing:**
  Each resource uploaded to OERchains is tagged with metadata such as subject, learning objectives, and accessibility options. You can choose to license your resources under various licenses, including Creative Commons, allowing others to use or remix your work within specified guidelines.

### Collaborative Learning

### Blockchain Integration for Data Ownership
