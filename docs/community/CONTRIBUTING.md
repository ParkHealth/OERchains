We welcome contributions in many forms! Here's how you can contribute:

### Reporting Bugs

### Contributing Code
- Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the GitHub project page to create a personal copy of the project.
- Create a new branch: It's always a good idea to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. This makes it easier to manage changes.
- Work on your changes: Make sure your code follows our coding standards, and feel free to ask if you're unsure about anything.
- Testing: Ensure your code works by writing appropriate tests and testing your changes.
- Submit a pull request (PR): Once you've made your changes, submit a PR to the main repository.

We follow a **fork-and-pull** model for contributions, which allows us to review your changes before they are merged into the project.
